# Sales Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising expenditures across three channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. By employing a Linear Regression model, the objective is to analyze the relationship between advertising spend and sales performance, ultimately helping businesses optimize their marketing strategies.

## Key Features
  Data Exploration: Loaded and explored the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and missing values.
  Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to create scatter plots and correlation heatmaps, visually assessing the relationships between variables.
  Model Building: Implemented a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn to predict sales. The data was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to validate model performance.
  Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model using key metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess accuracy.
  Coefficient Analysis: Analyzed the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each advertising channel on sales.
